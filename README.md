### Rust tree
---

* Unix style tree command written in Rust.
* The whole purpose of this is to get me more comfortable with writing Rust as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.
* Will be using this README to plan around the cli.


### Plan
---

* DON'T copy other similar projects (there are so many unix tree Rust projects out there).
* I allowed myself to read other implementations though so I can structure the project better (e.g in terms of flags, etc.)
* RTFM as a basis if I'm stuck and don't know how to implement.
* Review my own pull requests unless they're trivial (e.g updating readme) in which case push straight to main.


1. [ ]  RTFM


### TIL
---

* Day 3: to get len() or last element when we have an iterator we should collect into a vector
